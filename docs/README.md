# Bountiful Storytelling App Landing Page
The Bountiful Children's Foundation needs a way to collect success stories from 15 different countries, rather than losing them through email, Facebook messages, etc.

The Landing Page serves two purposes:
  1. Provide an accessible entry point for Bountiful coordinators to log into the app.
  2. Establish an online presence that attracts donors and volunteers.
